Project Description

In 2023, CDC receives alerts of an unusual, localized outbreak of Ebola virus in a major city, City X.  City X was affected by an Ebola outbreak in 2022, but no cases have been reported for more than six months.  To date, more than 500 cases have been reported in a short period of time, showing strong person-to-person transmission and a case fatality rate of 20%.  In another part of the state, only a few cases have been reported with no case fatalities.  Based on social media chatter, officials in City X suspect that the outbreak may have been caused by travelers from City Y or City Z in neighboring states. 

You have been tapped to join the agencyâ€™s response team investigating the source of this outbreak.  8 samples have been taken from City X, City Y, and City Z and sequenced at CDC to support the investigation.  Additionally, you will be provided with a reference collection of sequences from previously sequenced Ebola virus genomes as an additional aid.  You will be asked to investigate six tasks described below, ranging from general topics (e.g. assembly) to more challenging topics such as identification of SNPs or recombination events.  You are encouraged to use software tools that you are familiar with to address the tasks and incorporate them into a Nextflow workflow. 



Tasks

Participants are requested to perform the following tasks:

Identification of Ebola virus in the datasets
Metagenomic analysis of samples (presence of additional viruses)
Genomic characterization: assembly and annotation of the viral genome, lineage assignment
Strain identities: Identify closely related strains
(Bonus challenge) Phylogenetic placement of the sample strains with related strains
(Bonus challenge) Identification of peculiarities: identify SNPs or recombination vs a reference strain
